- **What was done:**
  - I started going through the RS Tandem final project task more carefully.  
  - I read the vision, requirements, diary rules, and scoring system to understand what is actually expected.
  - Got upset coz noted that the project format allows flexibility, but the product must still look consistent and “complete”.

- **Decisions / Notes:**
  - To contact with my teamates as quickly as possible. 

- **Problems / Questions:**
 Since this was the first deep reading of the task, I still had many open questions.
 I was mostly thinking about the overall direction of the project and how to keep it realistic for our team size and timeline.
 The challenge is to find a balance between something interesting/creative and something we can actually implement well.

- **Plans / Next steps:**
 For now, the plan is just to gather ideas, reflect on the task, and come prepared for the team discussion.

- **Time spent:** ~1.5–2 hours
