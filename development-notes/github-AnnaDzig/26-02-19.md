Yesterday we had a team call where we finally agreed on the project we are going to build.

After discussing different options earlier, we chose the **Widget Trainer** format.  
This direction feels realistic for our team size and timeframe, and it gives us enough flexibility to implement interesting interactive features.

- **What was done:**

I started focusing on my preparation and tasks.
- Refreshed parts of my React knowledge, especially component structure and state management
- Completed the creation and update of the README.md file (Week 1 checkpoint requirement)
- Continued exploring ideas for the UI layout and overall design

At this stage, my work is mainly centered around structuring and planning before moving deeper into implementation.

**Thoughts / Reflections:**

Now that we’ve chosen the project, things feel more clear.

Before, I was mostly thinking about different ideas and directions.  
Now I can focus on preparing for the actual work:
- refreshing React
- thinking through the UI
- keeping the MVP simple

**Next steps:**

- Continue React practice where needed
- Finalize layout ideas

---

**Time spent:** ~3 hours
