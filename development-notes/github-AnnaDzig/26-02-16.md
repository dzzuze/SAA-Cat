Today we had our first team call.
The main goal of this meeting was to get to know each other, discuss expectations, and talk through the Tandem final project format.

During the call:
We selected the Team Lead, decided to use Jira, discussed repository setup, and agreed on using React + Vite.  
We also planned the next call for 18.02.

This meeting was mainly about coordination and setting up our workflow.
