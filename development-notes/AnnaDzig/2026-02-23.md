- **What was done:**
Today I started with routing. At first it looked like a very simple task — just install `react-router-dom` and add a few routes.
I did the basic setup with `<BrowserRouter>` and `<Routes>`, added `MainPage`, checked that `/` works, and everything seemed fine.
But then I remembered our phone call — we agreed to use Firebase for authentication. That’s when I realized that simple routing wouldn’t be enough. If we’re going to use Firebase, we need proper protected routes and clear structure from the beginning.
So I stopped and refactored everything. I switched to `createBrowserRouter` because it feels more modern and scalable.

I reorganized routes into three groups:
- public pages
- guest-only pages
- protected pages

Then I implemented the structure using `ProtectedRoute` and `PublicOnlyRoute`.

- **Decisions / Notes:**

Decided to:
- use `createBrowserRouter` instead of classic `<BrowserRouter>`
- separate routes logically from the beginning
- prepare routing for Firebase integration instead of adding auth later

Also made sure routing is ready for future scaling.

- **Problems / Questions:**

Things became messy for a while.
First, the app showed a blank screen. After debugging, I discovered I had TWO `App.tsx` files in different folders. React was rendering the wrong one.
Then I accidentally mixed `BrowserRouter` and `RouterProvider`, which caused inconsistent behavior.
Later I got a TypeScript error:
> LoginPage cannot be used as a JSX component
Turned out I forgot a `return` statement in the component.
Small mistake, but it blocked everything.

- **Plans / Next steps:**

Next step is connecting Firebase authentication to routing and implementing `AuthProvider`.

- **Time spent:** ~5 hours
