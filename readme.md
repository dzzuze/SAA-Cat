# SAA Cat — Tandem Widget Trainer

## Project Description

SAA Cat is an interactive SPA designed for practicing programming concepts relevant to technical interviews.  
The application provides a collection of visual, gamified widgets that help users strengthen their knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript, and core computer science topics through hands-on interaction.

Users can explore topics, complete challenges, and track their learning progress in an engaging and intuitive environment.

## Project Name Origin

**SAA Cat** is derived from the first letters of our team members’ names:

- **S** — Sergey  
- **A** — Anna  
- **A** — Artem  

And **Cat**… because cats are cute 

The theme adds a light, friendly tone to the learning experience while keeping the educational focus.
